1303933513083699202	3	@lulumesum @PressSec @Darylmatla @Twitter I mean in New York they took sick coronavirus patients and put them in with our elderly kills over 11,000 that's just a number they released the rest they have yet to release it did the same thing in California Chicago all Democratic states did it why to blame Trump
1296459780433813504	3	Chairman Adam Smith, D-Wash., said “it’s not actually their job to warn the American people” about the coronavirus. This is both false and irresponsible. An independent study showed that if China would have acted just three weeks sooner, they could have stopped the spread by 95%.
1258571507212660741	3	@realDonaldTrump Governor Cuomo ordered nursing homes to accept covid 19 patients.  25 per cent of deaths in NY were  nursing home inhabitants who died alone.

1284720074708795398	3	You're so easily fooled. Death rates drop, so media steers us into a race war, then back to coronavirus again BUT this time it's all about CASES (cause we can drive that number up, just test more. and since we've all been exposes, antibodies are everywhere.
1292897846212153350	3	@Alyssa_Milano Whatever dr you're going to, is lying to you.

It's ranked between a cold &amp; the common flu. So, poor acting job!
1276242758290808832	3	@JoeConchaTV Is he talking about what Gov Cuomo did with placing coronavirus patients in with at-risk elderly patients in nursing homes? (Even though there were other available medical facilities available?)

1254070401203871744	3	@allisonpearson @AlexHeffron88 @queen_boudica_ But most of the elderly and vulnerable being sheltered rely on carers to support them. And those carers are more likely to catch coronavirus and pass it on to those they are caring for if selfish friends of yours decide it's fine for them to flout lockdown rules.
1255074261007585280	3	@bdly25 @elrington1952 @benjenkers @BBCBreaking If you die in hospital or a care home then they automatically put on the death certificate coronavirus it's a easy cop out as they don't have a autopsy now my mother was in a care home and I've seen how unclean they are and how the staff treat the old people
